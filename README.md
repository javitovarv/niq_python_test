# ml_eng_interview

Welcome to the ML Engineering Interview Project! This project is designed to evaluate your Python programming skills across various areas. 


First step is to setup environment, you can choose:
* use PDM to sync the environment
* use pip and requierements.txt


Please follow the steps below in the given order:

1. **fix_error_exercise.py**: Start with this exercise to demonstrate how you analyze and fix an error in the code. This will help us understand your debugging and problem-solving skills.

2. **simple_inheritance.py**: Proceed to this exercise to showcase your understanding of basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

3. **create_unit_test.py**: In this step, we want to evaluate your ability to write unit tests. Please create appropriate tests for the provided code.

4. **calculate_kpi.py**: Finally, work on this exercise to demonstrate how you approach solving a problem and implement a solution.
   
5. **Dockerfile**: Complete the dockerfile to execute the calculate_kpi.py


**Notes:**
- It is expected that you comment your thought process as you work through the exercises. This will help us understand your reasoning and problem-solving skills.
- You are allowed to use external information (libraries documentation) and resources to complete the tasks.

Feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear. Good luck!
